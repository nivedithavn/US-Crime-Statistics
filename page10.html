        <h3>Insights into Weekday-Weekend Crime Variation:</h3>
        <p>In scrutinizing the visualizations depicting the average response time of law enforcement from dispatch to arrival for reported crimes, notable patterns and potential contributing factors have been discerned.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Decline in Response Time Frequency:
            The temporal analysis reveals a discernible decline in the frequency of law enforcement response times, particularly evident from late 2019 to early 2020. A plausible contributing factor to this trend is the global pandemic, namely COVID-19. Although establishing a causal relationship between the pandemic and the observed decline is challenging, a conspicuous correlation is evident. The implementation of mandatory quarantines, especially in major metropolitan areas, may have led to a reduction in the deployment of law enforcement officers, thereby influencing response times.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Analytical Approaches:</h3>

    <p><strong>Temporal Analysis:</strong><br>
    Implementing time series analysis identifies anomalies and trends in law enforcement response times, offering insights into temporal dynamics.</p>

    <p><strong>Correlation Assessment:</strong><br>
    Computing Pearson correlation coefficients quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between response times and key events, revealing external influences.</p>

    <p><strong>Spatial Mapping:</strong><br>
    Utilizing geospatial mapping discerns regional variations in response times, enhancing understanding of localized pandemic impacts.</p>

    <p><strong>Cohort Stratification:</strong><br>
    Stratifying data based on geographic and demographic factors allows nuanced examination of response time variations across distinct segments.</p>

    <p><strong>Regression Modeling:</strong><br>
    Constructing regression models assesses the statistical significance of the pandemic's impact on response times, considering potential confounding variables.</p>
